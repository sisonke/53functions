* takes 2 parameters a list of words and the word to find in the list find the index of where the word is in the list and return it
	* can simulate dice rolls for the number of times specified as a parameter - display all the dice rolls.
	* return the sum of all the ascii codes for the letters that is being passed in as parameters.
	* returns all the letters in the alphabet which is even numbers and lower case
	* return the sum of the all the lower case letters ascii codes which is less than the parameters specified.
	* that can calculate currency conversions between ZAR, GBP and USD
	
	 
	 
	* that takes a function as a parameter which it executes when the (outer) function is called
	* that takes a function as a parameter and returns a function when executing the returned function it should pass all parameters to the initially passed in function

	* Write a program that gauges inflation. It should accept two prices (in whole dollars as input and print their difference, as well as the percentage increase to two decimal places. Then accept as input the number of weeks between the two prices, and compute the yearly rate of inflation (as percentage increase). http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/101/HomeworkProblems.html
